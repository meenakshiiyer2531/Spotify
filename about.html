          Spotify’s platform revolutionized music listening forever when we
          launched in 2008. Our move into podcasting brought innovation and a
          new generation of listeners to the medium, and in 2022 we entered the
          next audio market primed for growth with the addition of audiobooks.
          Today, more listeners than ever can discover, manage and enjoy over
          100 million tracks, 5 million podcast titles, and 350,000 audiobooks
          on Spotify. We are the world’s most popular audio streaming
          subscription service with more than 551 million users, including 220
